<div>Beachside Rehab was a life changing experience for me. I was so lost in life and my whole family had given up on me. Treatment was my last hope. I am so thankful I found Beachside. The therapy offices felt so comfortable and helped me calm down because I was so nervous. The beach houses were so comfortable I didnâ€™t want to leave! I really enjoyed all the activities, especially the beach barbecues. My time at Beachside really helped me to find peace and open up about my issues. I really want to thank the entire staff for everything they did to help me be a better person!!!</div><div class = "testimonialReviewer">Karen W. -- Feb 2014</div>

<div>Beachside was awesome. I was such a mess when I first got there but the staff helped me to understand why my life was falling apart. They made the whole process enjoyable. I liked how the houses were actually on the beach. I love the new sober life I live now and am rebuilding the trust with all of my family members. Beachside really helped turn my life towards a better path. Thanks everyone at Beachside!</div><div class = "testimonialReviewer">Ryan T. -- Feb 2014</div>
