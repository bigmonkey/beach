							<p>Beachside Rehab was a life changing experience for me. I was so lost in life and my whole family had given up on me. Treatment was my last hope. I am so thankful I found Beachside. The therapy offices felt so comfortable and helped me calm down because I was so nervous. The beach houses were so comfortable I didn’t want to leave! I really enjoyed all the activities, especially the beach barbecues. My time at Beachside really helped me to find peace and open up about my issues. I really want to thank the entire staff for everything they did to help me be a better person!!!<p><p class = "landReviewer">Karen W.</p>

							<p>Beachside was awesome. I was such a mess when I first got there but the staff helped me to understand why my life was falling apart. They made the whole process enjoyable. I liked how the houses were actually on the beach. I love the new sober life I live now and am rebuilding the trust with all of my family members. Beachside really helped turn my life towards a better path. Thanks everyone at Beachside!</p><p class = "landReviewer">Ryan T.</p>
